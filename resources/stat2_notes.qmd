## Important Concepts

### Terms

Trial
: A single performance of well-defined experiment 
Experiment

: a scientific test in which you perform a series of actions and carefully observe their effects in order to learn about something. or *An act that can be repeated under some specific condition.*

Random variable
: A variable whose values are associated with probability.

Sample space
: Set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment.

Sample point
: Each outcome of a sample space

Event
: Any subset of a sample space

Simple event
: An event having a single outcome

Compound/Composite event
: An event having more than one outcome

Impossible event
: An event which cannot happen (If P(A) = 0, then A is an impossible event)

Certain event
: An event which surely will or will not happen. (P(A) = 0 or 1)

Uncertain event
: An event which may or may not happen ($0 < P(A) < 1$)

Mutually Exclusive Event
: Events that cannot occur together. If $S = \{1,2,3,4\}, A = \{1,3\} \& C = \{4\}$ then A \& B are mutually exclusive.

Independent Event
: Events that do not affect each other. 

Complementary event
: Non-occurence of an event. $P(\bar A) = 1 - P(A)$, where $\bar A$ or $A'$ or $A^c$ is called complement of A. 

Exhaustive event
: Events whose union is equal to the sample space of the experiment (all outcomes are considered)

Equally likely events
: Events having same probability. If $S = \{1,2,3\}, P(1) = P(2) = P(3) = 1/3$, here 1, 2, and 3 are equally likely. One way for them not to be equally likely is: $P(1) = 1/2, P(2) = 1/5, P(3) = 1/4$

### Set Theory

NB: This is far from a comprehensive discussion of the set theory. 

#### Set Operations

Suppose, $A = \{1,3,4\}$ and $B = \{3,4,5\}$

- Union: A or B $\Rightarrow A\cup B = \{1,3,4,5\}$
- Intersection: A \& B $\Rightarrow A \cap B = \{3,4\}$
- Difference: $A - B = \{1\}$

#### Laws of Set

a. Cumulative law: $A \cup B = B \cup A$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$
b. Associative law: $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C$
c. Distribution law: $A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)$ and $A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$
d. De Morgan's law: 

    i. $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$
    ii. $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'$

**Verify De Morgan's law**

S = \{1, 2, 6, 8\}; A = \{1,4\}; B = \{2,6\}


### Permutaion

Permutaion is all about arranging items, while combination is used to find the ways to to select items. 

If we have 3 items A, B, and C; we can arrange them in the following way. 

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

There are 6 possible ways to arrange 3 items in 3 positions. 

Thinking another way, there are 3 positions and 3 items. The first position can be filled up in 3 ways (A or B or C), the second in 2 ways (after one item is fixed in the first position, be it A or B, or C), and the third in 1 way. 

\begin\{table\}[h]
\centering
\begin\{tabular\}\{|c|c|c|c|\}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
Possible options & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end\{tabular\}
\end\{table\}

Mathematically, this is also written as 3! (3 factorial), which is nothing but $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

Similarly, if we have 4 items to arrange in 4 places, we can write:

\begin\{table\}[h]
\centering
\begin\{tabular\}\{|c|c|c|c|l|\}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
Possible options & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end\{tabular\}
\end\{table\}

Thus we can arrange this in $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 4! = 24$ ways. 


#### Not Using All Items

Now, what if want to arrange 2 items out of 4 items. In this case we have 2 places, but 4 items. 

\begin\{table\}[H]
\centering
\begin\{tabular\}\{|c|c|c|\}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
Possible options & 4 & 3 \\ \hline
\end\{tabular\}
\end\{table\}

We get $4 \times 3 = 12$ ways. 

This is also written as $^4P_2 = 12$ (shown below)

$$^nP_r = \frac\{n!\}\{(n-p)!\}$$

#### Repeating Items 

In the above examples, items cannot be repeated in places. In some scenario, this is absurd; after all, one person cannot sit on 2 chairs. 

However, consider using digits to make up telephone numbers. 

\begin\{table\}[h]
\centering
\begin\{tabular\}\{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|\}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
Possible options & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 \\ \hline
\end\{tabular\}
\end\{table\}

All 10 digits can be used in each position. 

Hence, for 7-digit telephone numbers, we can have telephone number in $10^7$ ways. 

#### Think

- What is the general formula of the above case?[^1]
- What if the first digit is always zero (0)?
- What if not all 7 digits can be same?
- What if some particular digit cannot be repeated, or can be repeated only twice?
- How many license plates can make using 5 letters, 2 digits and 3 letters, or 1 letter and 3 digits, where items can be repeated?


### Combination

Combination is used when we are concerned with selecting items or individuals. 

**Example**: How can we select 2 items out of 3 (A, B, and C)? 

AB, AC, BC (AB = BA, AC = CA, BC = CB)

In permutation, we had 6 ways. The reason is obvious. 

#### Not Using All Items

$$^nC_r = \frac\{n!\}\{r!(n-r)!\}$$ 


#### Think

- In how many ways can a coach select 11 footballers from a squad of 15?
- What if s/he must keep 5 specific players?
- In how many ways the players can be placed in the field?

#### Think More

- How many 5-digit numbers can be made using the digits 4, 5, 2, 1, 0?
- How many are odd and even?
- How many end with zero?

## Three Definitions of Probability

#### Classical

$$P (A) = \frac\{n(A)\}\{n(S)\}$$

#### Relative frequency

$$\lim_\{n(S) \to \infty\} \frac\{n(A)\}\{n(S)\}$$

#### Axiomatic

Three axioms

Say, S is sample space and $A_i$ is an event 

- $0 \le P (A) \le 1$ <span style="color: red;">(NOT $P(A) \ge 0$)</span>
- At least one of S will occur. P (S) = 1; Certain event. 
- $P(A_1 U A_2 U ... U A_n)=P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$ or  
- $$P\left(\cup _\{i=1\}^\{\infty \}E_\{i\}\right)=\sum _\{i=1\}^\{\infty \}P(E_\{i\})$$


## Probability Theorems

1. If A and B are mutually exclusive, $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$. The law holds for more than 2 events as well, so $P(A \cup B \cup C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C)$ and so on. 

**Example:** $S = \{1, 2, 3\}; P(1 or 2) = P(1 \cup 2)$

2. If A and B are not mutually exclusive, $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.
3. If A and B are dependent events, $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B|A) = P(B) \times P(A|B)$


- $P(A) + P(\bar A) =1$ (prove)
- $\sum_\{i=1\}^k P(A_i) = 1$
- $P(\bar A\cap \bar B) = P(\overline\{A \cup B\}) = 1- P(A \cup B)$ (Venn)
- If A & B are independent, are $\bar A$ & $\bar B$ independent? (Prove by an example)


### Miscellaneous Problems

#### Leap year friday

What is the probability that there are 53 Fridays in a leap year? 

**Solution**

In a leap year, there are 366 days, i.e, 52 weeks and 2 days. In each week is a Fridays, so there are no less than 52 Fridays. 

The remaining two days could be:

(Sat, Sun); (Sun, Mon); (Mon, Tue); (Tue, Wedn); (Wedn, Thu); (Thu, Fri); (Fri, Sat) = 7

$P = \frac\{2\}\{7\}$

#### Numbers 10 through 30

Out of the natural numbers 10 through 30, a number is chosen randomly; what is the probability that the number is-

i. a prime number
ii. a prime number or multiple of 5
iii. a prime number or an odd number
iv. not a perfect square

#### Product of three positive integers

What is the probability that the product of three positive integers chosen from 1 through 100 is an even number?

**Solution**

There ar three possible cases: 
i. All three are even
ii. Two odd and one even number
iii. Two even and one odd

**Answer:** $P=\frac\{^\{50\}C_3\}\{^\{100\}C_3\}+2 \times \frac\{^\{50\}C_2 \times ^\{50\}C_1\}\{^\{100\}C_3\}$

## Coin and Die Problems

### Tree Method

The sample space if a coin is tossed thrice (or 3 coins tossed together) 

![](../img/stat/prob_tree.png)

In total, we have 8 outcomes. 

**Think:** What is the general formula? [^2]

### Table of Sample Space

**A coin is tossed twice**

|  | First Toss →  | H | T |
|---|---|---|---|
| Second Toss ↓ | H | HH | HT |
|  | T | TH | TT |

**A coin is tossed thrice**

|  | First 2 Toss → | HH | HT | TH | TT |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Third Toss ↓ | H | HHH | HHT | HTH | HTT |
|  | T | THH | THT | TTH | TTT |

Tables of higher order are similarly created using the combination of smaller tables. For example, the outcome of five tosses can be obtained by combining outcome of 3 tosses and that of 2 tosses. 

#### DIY

Using tree and table, make a sample space of 

- four coins tossed at once.
- 2 dice rolled together
- a coin and die thrown together
- 2 coins and a die

### Problems

1. A coin is flipped thrice. What is the probability that 

    a. the first toss gives Head
    b. The last two toss give Tails
    c. there exactly one H
    d. there are less than 3 heads

2. A coin and a die are thrown together. Find the probabilities that:
    a. the sample has an even digit
    b. the sample has a prime number

3. Two unbiased dice are rolled at once. Find the probabilities that:
    a. sum of the numbers is 7
    b. sum is less than 4
    c. both numbers are greater than 3
    d. the number are equal
    e. the numbers are different
    d. sum is a prime number    

#### Solution without creating sample space

**A fair coin is tossed 10 times.**

Find the probability that
    a. there are exactly 3 heads
    b. at least 2 heads
    c. more than 8 heads
    d. at best 1 tail

**Solution**

$$n(S) = 2^10$$   

a. there $^\{10\}C_3$ ways to select 3 items out of 10 items (heads)

For example 

\begin\{center\}

H T H T T T T H T T 

or

T T H T T T T H T H

\end\{center\}

If there are 3 tosses/coins, then 1 head can appear in the following ways. 

HTT THT TTH (also $^3C_1= 3$)

## Set Theory Problems
