## Important Concepts

### Terms

Trial
: A single performance of well-defined experiment 

Experiment
: a scientific test in which you perform a series of actions and carefully observe their effects in order to learn about something.

### Set Theory

### Permutaion

Permutaion is all about arranging items, while combination is used to find the ways to to select items. 

If we have 3 items A, B, and C; we can arrange them in the following way. 

- ABC
- ACB
- BAC
- BCA
- CAB
- CBA

There are 6 possible ways to arrange 3 items in 3 positions. 

Thinking another way, there are 3 positions and 3 items. The first position can be filled up in 3 ways (A or B or C), the second in 2 ways (after one item is fixed in the first position, be it A or B, or C), and the third in 1 way. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline
Possible options & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Mathematically, this is also written as 3! (3 factorial), which is nothing but $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$

Similarly, if we have 4 items to arrange in 4 places, we can write:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|l|}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline
Possible options & 4 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Thus we can arrange this in $4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 4! = 24$ ways. 


#### Not Using All Items

Now, what if want to arrange 2 items out of 4 items. In this case we have 2 places, but 4 items. 

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
Possible options & 4 & 3 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

We get $4 \times 3 = 12$ ways. 

This is also written as $^4P_2 = 12$ (shown below)

$$^nP_r = \frac{n!}{(n-p)!}$$

#### Repeating Items 

In the above examples, items cannot be repeated in places. In some scenario, this is absurd; after all, one person cannot sit on 2 chairs. 

However, consider using digits to make up telephone numbers. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Position & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 \\ \hline
Possible options & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 & 10 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All 10 digits can be used in each position. 

Hence, for 7-digit telephone numbers, we can have telephone number in $10^7$ ways. 

#### Think

- What is the general formula of the above case?[^1]
- What if the first digit is always zero (0)?
- What if not all 7 digits can be same?
- What if some particular digit cannot be repeated, or can be repeated only twice?
- How many license plates can make using 5 letters, 2 digits and 3 letters, or 1 letter and 3 digits, where items can be repeated?


### Combination

Combination is used when we are concerned with selecting items or individuals. 

**Example**: How can we select 2 items out of 3 (A, B, and C)? 

AB, AC, BC (AB = BA, AC = CA, BC = CB)

In permutation, we had 6 ways. The reason is obvious. 

#### Not Using All Items

$$^nC_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$ 


#### Think

- In how many ways can a coach select 11 footballers from a squad of 15?
- What if s/he must keep 5 specific players?
- In how many ways the players can be placed in the field?

#### Think More

- How many 5-digit numbers can be made using the digits 4, 5, 2, 1, 0?
- How many are odd and even?
- How many end with zero?

## Three Definitions of Probability

#### Classical

$$P (A) = \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$

#### Relative frequency

$$\lim_{n(S) \to \infty} \frac{n(A)}{n(S)}$$

#### Axiomatic

Three axioms

Say, S is sample space and $A_i$ is an event 

- $0 \le P (A) \le 1$ <span style="color: red;">(NOT $P(A) \ge 0$)</span>
- At least one of S will occur. P (S) = 1; Certain event. 
- $P(A_1 U A_2 U ... U A_n)=P(A_1) + P(A_2) + ... + P(A_n)$ or  
- $$P\left(\cup _{i=1}^{\infty }E_{i}\right)=\sum _{i=1}^{\infty }P(E_{i})$$


## Probability Theorems

- $P(A) + P(\bar A) =1$ (prove)
- $\sum_{i=1}^k P(A_i) = 1$
- $P(\bar A\cap \bar B) = P(\overline{A \cup B}) = 1- P(A \cup B)$ (Venn)
- If A & B are independent, are $\bar A$ & $\bar B$ independent? (Prove by an example)

## Coin and Die Problems

### Tree Method

The sample space if a coin is tossed thrice (or 3 coins tossed together) 

![](../../img/stat/prob_tree.png)

What is the general formula? [^2]



## Set Theory Problems 

## Problems: Drawing Items at Once

## Problems: Drawing Items One by One

## Addition vs Multiplication

## Playing card Concept and Problems

## Condional Probability Theory

## Condional Probability Problems

## Digit Problems

[^1]: $n^r$, where n = no. of items and r = no. of places
[^2]: $2^n$ for a coin and $6^r$ for a die. What would be a more general formula?
