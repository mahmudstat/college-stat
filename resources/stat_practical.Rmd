# Determination of Arithmetic Mean, Combined Arithmetic Mean, Geometrci Mean, and Harmonic Mean from Grouped and Ungrouped Data.

# Construction of Histogram and Ogive

## Problem

Given below are daily wages of 30 workers in an agency. 

\begin{center}
\textbf{515, 833, 938, 511, 960, 968, 542, 842, 767, 694, 674, 955, 675, 972, 501, 987, 708, 846, 568, 721, 592, 867, 644, 966, 663, 551, 746, 942, 760, 601}
\end{center}

Draw a Histogram and an Ogive from the data and interpret.

## Solution

### Theory

A histogram is constructed from a frequency distribution with continuous class intervals. The frequencies corresponding to different classes are shown on the axis as bars, leaving no space or gap between the bars.
