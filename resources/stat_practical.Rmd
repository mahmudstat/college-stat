# Determination of Arithmetic Mean, Combined Arithmetic Mean, Geometrci Mean, and Harmonic Mean from Grouped and Ungrouped Data.

# Construction of Histogram and Ogive

## Problem

Given below are daily wages of 30 workers in an agency. 

\begin{center}
\textbf{515, 833, 938, 511, 960, 968, 542, 842, 767, 694, 674, 955, 675, 972, 501, 987, 708, 846, 568, 721, 592, 867, 644, 966, 663, 551, 746, 942, 760, 601}
\end{center}

Draw a Histogram and an Ogive from the data and interpret.

## Solution

### Theory

A histogram is constructed from a frequency distribution with continuous class intervals. The frequencies corresponding to different classes are shown on the axis as bars, leaving no space or gap between the bars. 

# Determination of Quartiles, Deciles, and Percentiles

## Problem

Given below are temperatures (in degree Celsius) of a city in 30 random days in a year. 

\begin{center}
33.86, 34.83, 35.59, 31.66, 26.31, 26.90, 33.10, 26.52, 35.17, 25.21, 25.28, 28.38, 29.62, 30.69, 32.72, 30.00, 30.14, 27.97, 28.45, 35.93, 33.34, 29.07, 34.00, 27.55, 34.03, 33.76, 29.48, 31.24, 33.79, 33.41
\end{center}

Find the quartiles, 4th and 7th Decile, and 35th \& 87th Percentiles from the data and interpret. 

## Solution

### Theory

Determination of First Quartile

Let n = no. of observations

If n = odd

Location of first quartile = $\frac{n+1}{4}$th item 

Location of 2nd quartile = $\frac{2(n+1)}{4}$th item 

Other quantiles are determined in the same way. 

If n = even

Location of first quartile = $\frac{\frac n4 th + \frac{(n+1)}4th}{2}$

Location of 2nd quartile = $\frac{\frac {2n}4 th + \frac{2(n+1)}4th}{2}$

Other quantiles are determined similarly. 

The general formula to find the ith quantile, which divides the dataset into k parts.

\[
Q_i = \frac{i(n+1)}{k}th; \text{if n is odd}
\]

\[
Q_i = \frac{\frac{in}{k}th+(\frac{in}{k}+1)th}{2}; \text{if n is even}
\]
