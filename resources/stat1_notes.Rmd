## Measures of Central Tendency

### Important Formulae

- $M_o = 3Me - 2 \bar X$

## Moments, SKewness, and Kurtosis

### Problems

####  Moment Conversion: -1, 5, 20, 90. 

The first four moments around 2 of a data set are -1, 5, 20, 90. Determine $\mu_3$ and kurtosis. 

**Solution**

$\displaystyle \mu_1' = \frac {\sum_{i=1}^{n}}{n} -1$

$displaystyle \Rightarrow \frac{\sum x_i}{n}-a=-1$

$\Rightarrow \bar x - a = a-1$

Thus, $b = a-k = a-a+1=1$

Without knowing the initial origin, we can compute central moments, but not other raw moments. 



# Time Series

## Concept of time series

A time series is a collection of observations arranged chronologically (belonging to different time period, e.g., week, month, year etc.)

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 

"A time series is a collection of observations of well-defined data items obtained through repeated measurements over time."

Mathematically, a time series is $Y_t = f(t); t = t_1, t_2, \cdots, t_n$

**Examples**

i. No. of accidents by day
ii. Tea production in Bangladesh by year

## Components of time series

a. Trend
b. Seasonal variation
c. Cyclic variation
d. Irregular/random variation

### Elaboration on the concepts

#### Trend

Increase of decrease in the values over time. There are two types of trends.

i. Upward trend
ii. Downward trend

Both types can be further divided into two kinds of trends.

i. Linear trend
ii. Non-linear trend

### Seasonal variation

Changes in values due to season within a year, due to climate or festival. 

**Examples**

i. The increase of demand of dates during Ramadan
ii. The increase of demand of umbrella during the rainy season

### Cyclic variation

Recurrent upward or downward movements, when the period of cycle is greater than a year, but the period is not fixed.
