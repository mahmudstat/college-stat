# GCD-LCM

## GCD or HCF

**Greatest Common Divisor/Highest Common Factor**

GCD of 30 \& 40 

Divisors/factors

$30: 1, 2, 3, \cdots ,15$

$40: 1, 2, \cdots, 20$

Common factors: $1, 2, 5, \cdots$

Greatest Common Factor: 

### GCD of Fractions 

$\frac12$ \& $\frac 13$ 

$\frac12 \rightarrow \frac 12, \frac 14, \cdots$

$\frac13 \rightarrow \frac 13, \frac 16, \cdots$

Which ones are common?

Which one is greatest?

## Which fraction is greater?

\begin{center}
$$\frac1 {12}, \frac 1 {10}$$
\end{center}

Logically why?

From the same amount, taking 1 part out of 12 is less than taking 1 part out of 10 parts. 

Each part is less if we divide into 12 parts than into 10 parts. 

### When Common Factors are Rare

Find GCD

$$\frac14 \text{&} \frac 3{11}$$

### Formula of GCD-LCM for fractions

$$GCD = \frac{\text{GCD of Numerators}}{\text{LCM of Denominators}}$$

$$LCM = \frac{\text{LCM of Numerators}}{\text{GCD of Denominators}}$$
### Difference between mulplier and divisor

$$7 \times 3 = 21$$

$7 \rightarrow Multiplier$

$3 \rightarrow Multiplicand$

$21 \rightarrow Product$

$\frac{20}{4} = 5$

$20 \rightarrow Dividend$

$4 \rightarrow Divisor$

$5 \rightarrow Quotient$ (Remainder 0)
